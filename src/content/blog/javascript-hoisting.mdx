JavaScript hoisting refers to the interpreter moving the declarations of variables, functions, and classes to the top of their scope before execution.

Some may find hoisting beneficial, but it may produce unexpected errors, and is generally not recommended.

## Function hoisting

Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

```js
sayHello();

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello there!");
}
```

## Variable hoisting

Variables are also hoisted, so you can use variables before their declaration.

However, JavaScript only hoist declarations and **not initializations**. This means that variables declared using `var` will have the hoisted value of `undefined` otherwise uninitialized.

### `var` hoisting

```javascript
console.log(num); // undefined
var num;
num = 2;
console.log(num); // will log 2
```

The same behavior happens when the declaration and initialization happens in one line.

```javascript
console.log(num); // undefined
var num = 2;
console.log(num); // will log 2
```

### `let` and `const` hoisting

Variables declared using `let` and `const` are also hoisted but doesn't have a default value of `undefined` and will throw an exception if read before its initialization.

```javascript
console.log(num); // Uncaught ReferenceError: num is not defined
let num = 2;
```

## `class` hoisting

Classes defined using a class declaration are hoisted, which means that JavaScript has a reference to the class. However the class is not initialized by default, so any code that uses it before the line in which it is initialized is executed will throw a ReferenceError.

## Function and class hoisting

function expression and class expression is not hoisted.
