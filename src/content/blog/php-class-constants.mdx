## Introduction

PHP constants are immutable meaning you can't change their value once it is defined. PHP allows developers to associate constants per class with the default visibility of public.

<Alert>
    Class constants can also be defined by a child class.
</Alert>

To define a class constant, use the `const` keyword followed by the constant property name and value. For constant's property name, it is a standard practice to use uppercase and underscore's for spacing.

```php
class Status {
    private const PAID = 'paid';
    public const PENDING = 'pending';
}
```

Just like [static properties or methods](/php-static-properties-and-methods-in-object-oriented-php), class constants are allocated to the class itself and not to the class instance.

This means you can also access the class constants outside by using the **scope resolution operator** and inside using either the class name or the `self` keyword.

<Alert>
    A class also have a built-in constant named `class` which resolves at compile time and returns a fully qualified class name.
</Alert>

```php
namespace App\Modules;

class Status {
    private const PAID = 'paid';
    public const PENDING = 'pending';

    public getPaidStatus() {
        return self::PAID; // or Status::PAID
    }
}

$transaction = new Transaction();

echo Status::PENDING; // pending
echo $transaction->getPaidStatus(); // paid
echo Status::class; // App\Modules\Status
```

## Use-case of class constants

### Single source of truth

If you have information that does not change, and you keep referencing it all over the code. It is better to move to a single class, this way if the time comes that you need to change the constant you just need to change it in one place.
