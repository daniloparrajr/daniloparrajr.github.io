Is like a template or the base class that child classes can extend from using inheritance.

## Rules
### Parent class
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, you can only extend it.
- Abstract classes can contain regular methods and properties aside from abstract methods.
- Abstract methods only have the definition and not the implementation. Knows the "what" but doesn't know the "how".
- If a class have at least one abstract method the class should be abstract.

### Child class
- Child class must implement the parent's abstract methods.
- TODO: Can child class inherit parents regular methods and properties? Probably yes
- Overriding abstract method on child class can have custom parameters but must have default values to work.
- Abstract method visibility should be either public or protected. TODO: Can I make a protected to public?
- If  a child class doesn't implement the abstract method, the child class should be made abstract.

## When should you use an abstract class?
When you want to force the child classes to implement the methods while you provide some base functionalities.
