## Solution

Make sure local repo is updated by

```console
git pull --rebase
```

Go to the feature branch and rebase to the main branch

```console
git switch <feature-branch>
git rebase main
```

If there's a conflict, simply fix the conflict and add the fix by

```console
git add .
```

Once satisfied with the fix, continue rebasing by

```console
git rebase continue
```
