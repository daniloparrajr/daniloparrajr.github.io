## Introduction

Static properties and methods belong to the class itself and not to any particular object/instance. You can use it directly using the class name.

To define a static property or method simply add the keyword `static` before or after the access modifier.

You can now access the static property/method by simply using the scope resolution operator `::` after the class name.

When referencing static properties you can either use the keyword `self` or the class name.

<Alert>
    Since static methods is not associated with an object, you don't have access to the `$this` keyword. If a static method needs to have access to a non-static properties, then it should not be a static method.

```php
class Transaction {
   // Define $count property as static.
	private static int $count = 15;

	public function __construct(
		public float $amount,
		public string $description,
	) {
    // Using the keyword `self` to refer the static $count property.
		self::$count++;
	}

	public static getCount() {
    // a static method used to access the static property $count.
		return self::$count;
	}
}

// Using the scope resolution operator to access the static method.
echo Transaction::getCount();
```

## Use-case of static methods and properties

Using static properties and methods are generally bad practice because it's against the OOP principle. But there are some use-case for it.

- cache some value e.g. as counter
- memorization e.g. cache the result of some expensive operations.
- singleton pattern
- utility functions
- factory pattern
- static closure â†’ to prevent access to object properties
