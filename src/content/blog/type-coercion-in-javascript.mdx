Type coercion is the implicit process of converting values from one type to another (such as string to number, object to boolean, and so on).

## Coercion in computation

`-`, `*`, `/`, `%` - Operators that automatically converts to number

```javascript
2 + true; // 3, because true is converted to 1
2 - false; // 2, because false is converted to 0
2 * "2"; // 4
10 / "2"; // 5
```

The addition sign is different on all these operators because it will prioritize concatenating strings rather than converting to number.

```javascript
2 + "2"; // 22
2 - "2"; // 0
```

## Coercion in conditional statements

Type coercion also happens when checking for [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) or [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) values.

```javascript
let num = 10;

if (num) {
  console.log("num is truthy!");
  // 10 is truthy so this condition will execute.
}

let num = 0;

if (!num) {
  console.log("num is falsy!");
  // 10 is falsy so this condition will execute.
}
```
